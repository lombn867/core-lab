                    Nora Lombardo is a designer, writer, and photographer based in New York City.
                    Born and raised in what is dubbed the "sixth burough," Yonkers is where Arony N came to fruition.
                    Arony N describes the artist behind mixed-media works commenting on themes of objectification, youth, mental health, and identity. 
                    Belonging to the Communication Design Department for Parsons at The New School, 
                    the young artist hopes to compose a series of works that lend themselves to further developing and understanding her identity in the design world.
